# Fall 2024 React Workshops
This repository contains the code for the Fall 2024 BU Hack4Impact JDT workshops focusing on React. We worked on moving our personal website we created using HTML, CSS, and JS in the [alpha repository](https://github.com/Hack4Impact-BU/JDT-fall-24-alpha/) onto React, and then added an AI chat feature as well as a database to keep track of chat logs. We used MongoDB to host our database, and gave the option to delete any user input and AI response from the database.

These workshops ran weekly on Tuesday evenings from November 5th, 2024 to November 26th, 2024. You can access the slides for the workshops here (TBA).
